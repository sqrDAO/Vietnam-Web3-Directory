# Vietnam Web3 Directory

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the Vietnam Web3 Directory landing page, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Ensure you are in the project directory where the `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files are located.

3. **Open the HTML File**:
   You can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser. Simply double-click the file or right-click and select "Open with" and choose your preferred web browser.

4. **Using a Local Server (Optional)**:
   For a better experience, especially if you plan to use AJAX or fetch data, you can run a local server. Here are a few options:
   - **Using Python**:
     - If you have Python installed, you can run a simple HTTP server with:
       ```bash
       # For Python 3.x
       python -m http.server
       ```
       Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

   - **Using Node.js**:
     - If you have Node.js installed, you can use the `http-server` package:
       ```bash
       npm install -g http-server
       http-server
       ```
       Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.

5. **Deploying to a Hosting Service**:
   If you want to deploy the landing page to a hosting service, you can use platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. Here’s a brief overview of how to deploy using GitHub Pages:
   - Push your code to a GitHub repository.
   - Go to the repository settings.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `gh-pages`).
   - Click "Save" and your site will be published at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

6. **Access the Landing Page**:
   Once deployed, you can access your landing page using the URL provided by your hosting service.

Feel free to customize the instructions based on your specific deployment needs or preferences.
